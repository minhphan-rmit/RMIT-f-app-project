                        “I have been interested in IT since I was three years old. I tried to get into the
                        IT specialized high school class but failed the test. From that moment, my IT passion went down.
                        However, when I was thinking about my university major, IT just popped up again, which is why I
                        am studying IT at RMIT. I am logical and practical (my personality type is INTP), and I also
                        like math. That is why I think IT is suitable for me. Besides the enjoyment of working with
                        computers, I do enjoy how IT is helping to develop our life. For example, smart homes are an
                        application of IT technologies, making our lives easier. Personally, there are two reasons why I
                        am interested in this topic/project. First, I want to experience working on a team project that
                        follows professional criteria. Second, the idea quite suits my needs. I am trying to balance
                        studying and being healthy simultaneously, so I need the project’s outcome.

                        I am a practical and logical person. That is why I am planning to study two minors: Data
                        Analytics and Cloud Technology. After graduation, I will apply for two positions based on my
                        minors: Cloud Engineer and Data Analyst. These entry-level jobs will give me opportunities to
                        work for big companies so that I can gain experience in a professional setting. After that, I
                        have two plans for myself. If I get promoted and get a better position or job, I will stick to
                        that job and develop myself further. Otherwise, I want to start my own business after taking an
                        MBA."

                        I have always wanted to run a company that makes electronic devices. I have long been interested
                        in high-tech electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and VR. In particular, I liked
                        to compare their strengths and weaknesses and analyze which are more competitive and why some
                        products are famous and less popular. These hobbies and interests naturally led me to be
                        interested in big data and data analytics, which mine and analyze valuable data among numerous
                        user data. Before running a company, it was essential to understand the process and strategy of
                        Big Tech companies planning, producing, and selling their products. RMIT University provides
                        internships for many global companies, so I chose the data analysis minor at RMIT University's

                        IT field, then go back to Korea and join the army. I will apply for a software developer

                        me make contact with the rapidly changing IT sector without wasting time in the military. After

                        graduating and more opportunities to participate in good companies. Since I was a child, I have
                        fallen in love with music, and my dream is to become a music composer and singer. However, when
                        I grew up, I realized that I could not make money with my talent; as a result, I decided to
                        learn as a student in the Bachelor of Information Technology course at RMIT. Although I do not
                        have any experience in IT, I believe that RMIT could train me and make me a better version.

                        for IT might help me have many opportunities in the future, including taking part in a
                        technology multinational company or being a leader of a big project for my host company. When

                        and experiences from others, especially people from other parts of the world. After working for
                        a long time and getting enough experience, I might run my own business and try my best to reach
                        my dream. If I succeed, I can do another job, such as becoming a singer, to make a variety of

                        Technology, in general, has been one of my top interests since I was a child. Furthermore,
                        information technology has recently proven itself to be the "next big thing," the core
                        foundation of the fourth industrial revolution. This has struck me as an unmissable chance to
                        pursue something I enjoy while making a living. With that in mind, in high school, I put effort
                        into laying the bedrock for it by familiarizing myself with primary coding language and critical
                        thinking. On that groundwork, I intend to further improve my skill and knowledge of the field

            <p>
                After using GitHub for a while, we all realized the benefits and advantages of GitHub and understood why
                most IT professionals and systems use GitHub to organize their projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, GitHub helps us store our source code and files like cloud storage like Google Drive or OneDrive.
                This feature is convenient because, as a team project, we all work on the same file and use the same
                documents, so storing it in the same directory makes it easier for all of us to find and use any files
                of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, besides the storing function, the audit trail helps us keep track of what is happening. We can
                quickly know who edited this file and who created another file. Furthermore, most importantly, all the
                previous versions of a file will be saved so that if we make any mistakes, we can turn back to the old
                version of that file. The audit trail is essential in IT in general because in a large project, for
                example, a mobile app project, we have many functions, and we can not finish it in 1 day, and we have to
                work for days, months or even years. In that long period, mistakes will be made, and sometimes, we have
                to turn back where we started. That is why GitHub is so helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those benefits affect our productivity. We can track others' progress using GitHub. We saved time by
                turning back to the working version and not affecting the whole project by mistake.

                        Numerous people are concerned about nutritional imbalance and the rise in obesity rates.
                        According to Shattuck (2035), obesity rates did not exceed 15% in any U.S. state in 1985; by
                        2016, no state had a rate under 20%. Currently, the average obesity rate is over 33%. Correcting
                        dietary imbalances will benefit society. As rates of physical activity have decreased, there is
                        an increasing epidemic of obesity (Skinner et al., 2018, cited in Armstrong, 2019). IT
                        professionals are not exempt from this rule. In particular, persons who spend several hours
                        sitting in chairs and avoid outdoor activities are more likely to be exposed to obesity or
                        underweight risks.

                        As a result, our group developed an interest in the topic of nutritional imbalance. BMI is one
                        of the well-known and practical measurements of obesity. Individuals can quickly determine their
                        present physical state by dividing one's weight by the square of height. Our group identified
                        areas for improvement in other BMI calculators. This was the issue with only giving out the
                        necessities of data, such as the present situation and statistics. Our group believed it would
                        be more practical if it offered suggestions as to what types of management are required beyond
                        just calculating BMI. Therefore, we decided to develop a calculator that does not require users
                        to check their BMI, search for exercises online, or find another calculator to see how many
                        calories they consumed today. Using our project, users can calculate their daily caloric intake
                        and receive suggestions depending on their BMI. This lets users know whether they should reduce
                        their diet, exercise, or increase their diet.

                        After the COVID-19 pandemic and a long period of working from home, people started realizing how
                        important it is to be physically and mentally healthy. Based on that realization, we developed a
                        virtual assistant for health care. This project can change the habits of the majority of people
                        about their awareness of their health and help people have a better and healthier life.

                        Smartphones have become an indispensable part of our lives in the past 20 years; we can easily
                        access services using smartphones, from payment, transportation and socialization. That is why
                        we developed a cross-platform virtual assistant available on mobile devices such as smartphones,
                        laptops, and tablets. The trend of mobile applications will last for many years. Even when
                        augmented reality and virtual reality become popular soon, it will be an opportunity for us to
                        make our product more "realistic."

                        This project is not just a "school project" or an average group project. This project is a
                        replication of real-life IT-related projects. As a result, working on this project brings us
                        many benefits. Firstly, we have a chance to work in a professional environment. We do documents
                        like proposals, reports, meeting minutes, and papers. We do academic research for our project
                        idea; we have to obey different work ethics from the typical projects. Secondly, we learn how to
                        work effectively in a group, a department, or similar. We learn how to stay in touch with
                        people, teammates, and other departments; we learn how to communicate professionally. In
                        conclusion, we can gain many invisible benefits from working on a project, like technical skills
                        and knowledge aside from professional workflow. This is an excellent opportunity to prove to
                        employers that we can fit into their business.

                        Our project idea is not highly distinguishable from those on the market. There are many similar
                        products with similar functions to ours. We chose two products that already exist to give an
                        overview of similar products:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nike Training Club is a fitness app from Nike, Inc.</li>
                        <li>We Do Pulse is a personal health assistant made by PULSE ECOSYSTEM PTE. LTD.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Both products mentioned above have almost the same features as our apps. However, these products
                        consistently receive bad reviews because of a bad user experience. The common problems of the
                        competitors are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The free plans and programs could be more helpful.</li>
                        <li>The programs provided need to be more general and personalized for every user.</li>
                        <li>The app's user interface could be more attractive and easy to use.</li>
                        <li>Most of the time, the users will feel "lonely" because their assistant is not really an
                            assistant.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Based on users' needs, we aim to solve all the abovementioned problems. Besides providing
                        programs through computer calculation and AI in the future, we plan to provide a platform to
                        connect trainers and users. This feature will make our product more user-friendly and
                        customizable. Furthermore, we are focusing on developing UX and UI together to make the app more
                        easy-to-use and attractive.

                <div class="text-paragraph">
                    <p>
                        Based on the disadvantages of other similar products that we mentioned above, we can easily
                        define our most important aim for this project:
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: center;">A “real” virtual trainer</h4>
                    <p>
                        Being fit and healthy does not mean that you have to work hard like a natural bodybuilder. They
                        are usually simple exercises at home, such as a morning trek in a nearby park, but you may
                        occasionally lose your track; you may need help knowing where to begin or continue your track.
                        This is when a virtual trainer comes in handy. A virtual trainer provides a training program and
                        tracks your progress, giving personalized advice based on your status.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to be a "real" virtual trainer, we have defined some goals for our process of
                        development:
                    </p>
                    <!--Goals-->
                    <div>
                        <!--Goal 1-->
                        <div>
                            <h4>The most attractive UI</h4>
                            <p>
                                For us, UI is one of the essential parts of a mobile app's success. An attractive and
                                energetic UI is a big motivation for our users. Looking at and using a colorful and
                                motivating app encourages our users to work out and stay healthy.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <!--Goal 2-->
                        <div>
                            <h4>The best UX</h4>
                            <p>
                                Building a system that has a good user experience is a big challenge for every project.
                                There are two main points on which we will focus on the UX of our product: simplify the
                                way of using the app by easing the connection between users and trainers, and
                                personalize the app as much as possible for every user so that they will feel cared for
                                and motivated.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <!--Goal 3-->
                        <div>
                            <h4>Verified trainers</h4>
                            <p>
                                Our product is not only for users who want to stay healthy but also for trainers who are
                                passionate about bodybuilding and willing to share their knowledge to help others stay
                                healthy. This will help them develop their passion and provide a source of income.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Besides the aim of the product, that aim sounds a bit "technical," we have another aim that is
                        more "social," and this is as important as the aim mentioned above:
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: center;">A healthy community (F-APP community)</h4>
                    <p>
                        When the app gets released to the market, it will not only help every user individually, but it
                        will be a platform that connects people, helps people make friends, share their progress, and
                        helps others reach their goals. This will affect society's awareness about their health,
                        creating a healthier, more connected society.

                            An early prototype to demonstrate the
                            operation of the app helps us analyze the pros
                            and cons of the project so that we can make

                            2D demonstrations like in the previous

                            the user interface will be added, while the
                            functions will be fixed and developed at the
                            same time. The final outcome should be an
                            almost complete product that can be released to
                            the market. Keep in mind that after this
                            phase, the app’s development will continue until

                            testing department does its job. The app should
                            be tested carefully in 2 months for minor
                            bugs and errors, user experience problems,...
                            All of these should be fixed or redeveloped
                            before release.

                            will be released for actual users. The trial

                            about the market. This is helpful for the

                            After a long period of time of developing and
                            testing, we can officially release the first
                            version of our product to the market. The
                            product has to strictly pass the testing phase
                            to
                            be released. This is when our - development team
                            - can see how our product operates in a
                            real-life environment, in practical situations.

                            Every IT-related project never ends. Ours is not
                            an exception. After releasing, we will keep
                            getting feedback from users and make
                            improvements from that. Besides, more new
                            functions
                            will be added to the product, and existing
                            functions will be improved. Furthermore, our
                            product can be turned into a cross-platform
                            application or even a company, an "empire" of
                            fitness.

                            development phases, merging these roles helps us save human resources and expenses.</li>
                        <li>A UI designer's job is to design the visual look of the software.</li>
                        <li>A UX designer's job is to design the way the software works (for example, the chat box
                            between the user and trainer must be eye-catching and visible so that the user can easily
                            access the app functions without complicated and tedious instructions)

                        <li>This is one of the most critical departments of the project because it helps the team manage

                    <li>Risk management while running the project is challenging because we have little experience

                <h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
                <p class="text-paragraph">
                    This project is about developing a cross-platform application that requires a large combination of
                    tools and technologies to develop the product. We divided the products into groups based on their
                    purpose (or group of tasks):
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h4>Project management tools</h4>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        Tools: Google Drive; Google Docs; Google Sheets; GitHub
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        Google Cloud and other Google products are mainly for making documents like reports, meeting
                        minutes and presentation scripts and storing those documents on the cloud. GitHub is for storing
                        and a shared workspace for source code from the application and group’s website also.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h4>UI and UX design tools</h4>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        Tools: Adobe Photoshop (Version 24.1); Adobe Illustrator (Version 35.1.1); Figma (Version 9.0);
                        Adobe XD (Version 55.2.35)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UI and UX are critical parts of our project, so choosing the right tools is essential. For
                        graphics, we use Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. These are the most popular design tools
                        right now on the market, so there is no doubt that these are the right tools for designing
                        graphics for the UI. There is an alternative tool that we found beneficial recently - Figma.
                        From the graphics above, we need a tool that combines all the graphics into the actual interface
                        for the app; our choice is Adobe XD. Adobe XD is the tool for visualizing how our user interface
                        interacts with the user experience. This helps the business department manage the business
                        requirements, and the technical department develops the UI and UX technically.

                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        Tools: Xcode (Version 14.2); Android Studio Dolphin (Version 2021.3.1); ReactNative (Version

                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        Our application is a cross-platform application, so there are different tools for different
                        platforms.

                        <p class="text-paragraph">
                            There are two popular operating systems, iOS and Android, so we will use Xcode (for iOS
                            devices) and Android Studio (for Android devices). These tools are for building the base of
                            the application.

                            After building the base for the application, our choice for building the UI for the
                            application is React Native. This is an open-source tool developed by the Facebook
                            community. It is based on JavaScript technology and, more importantly, cross-platform.

                            This dynamic website links to our mobile application version, so HTML, CSS and JavaScript
                            are the best choices for us. The IDE we choose is Visual Studio Code, a free IDE from
                            Microsoft. There are some additional tools for the database, such as SQL or cloud
                            technologies, but at this phase of the project, we intend on building the website version so
                            that we will have research later.

                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        Image analysis is the main technology for our product. This technology helps us analyze the
                        correctness of the exercises when the user is working out and calculating the amount of food.

                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p class="text-paragraph">
                    Our group tried avoiding a giant bug or problem after the release. We expected that finding and
                    resolving bugs in the development process would increase development and operational efficiency
                    rather
                    than creating bugs after our project releases. We referred to "AGILE DEVELOPMENT CYCLE" to make
                    specific
                    software.
                </p>
                <p class="text-paragraph">
                    The reason why our group decided to use the "AGILE DEVELOPMENT CYCLE" is that it requires continuous
                    and
                    continuous interaction and debugging. In addition, these short-period interactions will allow all
                    our
                    team members to participate continuously in the debugging process, enhancing their understanding of
                    the
                    project and ensuring that they remember the project's progress. This cycle should be implemented
                    whenever there are new changes or functionality additions to our website.

                <p class="text-paragraph">
                    We made a requirement to distinguish whether our test was successful or unsuccessful. We provide an
                    example of the website's requirements (expected results) by referring to the Behavior-driven
                    development
                    (BDD) model. The defined conditions of these dictionaries aim to be as clear and objective as
                    possible
                    to reduce confusion. As a result, these conditions (expected results) aim to help provide the tester
                    with clear acceptance criteria.

                        courses and working on various projects, so that time management will be a big challenge. Lack
                        of time can cause low-quality outcomes when working on projects.

                        <strong>Problem: </strong>Our product is a cross-platform app project. As a result, it requires
                        a lot of soft skills and knowledge. For example, the project's development stage requires
                        in-depth knowledge of Objective-C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, database, cloud, etc. As newbies
                        in IT, we need to learn more about these requirements, so we cannot fully develop the project in
                        a limited time.
