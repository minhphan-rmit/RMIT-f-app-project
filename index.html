                    F-APP is short for Fitness App. We came up with this name
                    randomly in a past meeting, it meets our
                    criteria: as few syllables as possible and easy to remember.
                    But we are planning to have an alternative
                    name for the project product that is more meaningful and
                    memorable also.

                        I considered myself a practical and logical person. That
                        is why I am planning to study two minors:
                        Data Analytics and Cloud Technology. After graduation, I
                        will apply for 2 positions based on my
                        minors: Cloud Engineer or Data Analyst. These
                        entry-level jobs will give me opportunities to work
                        for big companies so that I can gain experience in a
                        professional setting. After that, I have two
                        plans for myself. If I get promoted and get a better
                        position or job, I will stick to that job and
                        develop myself further. Otherwise, I want to start my
                        own business after taking an MBA.

                        “My name is Nguyen Ngoc Kim, a member of Group 49, which
                        also has Phan Nhat Minh, Jimin Cho, and
                        Luong Anh Huy. I was born in Thai Nguyen Province, and
                        my family has six people in total, including
                        my grandparents, my parents, my younger brother, and me.
                        My parents and I decided to study at RMIT
                        University because we believed that I could have a
                        better academic background after graduating and
                        more opportunities to participate in good companies.
                        Since I was a child, I have fallen in love with
                        music, and my dream is to become a music composer and
                        singer. However, when I grew up, I realized
                        that I could not make money with my talent; as a result,
                        I decided to learn as a student of the
                        Bachelor of Information Technology course at RMIT.
                        Although I do not have any experience in IT, I
                        believe that RMIT could train me and make me a better
                        version.”

                        As a student of the Bachelor of Information Technology,
                        I believe that I will have a good background
                        as well as a better start than others when I have a job
                        in the future. The RMIT education and my
                        passion for IT might help me have a lot of opportunities
                        in the future, including taking part in a
                        technology multinational company or being a leader of a
                        big project for my host company. In my
                        opinion, when working in a large group, I wish I could
                        contribute all my skills and knowledge and
                        learn new things and experiences from others, especially
                        people from other parts of the world. After
                        working for a long time and getting enough experience, I
                        might run my own business, and I will try
                        my best to reach my dream. If I succeed, I can do
                        another job, such as becoming a singer, to make a
                        variety of incomes for my life.

                    Everything is still in control. Even though
                    we missed some of our deadlines, we are trying our best to
                    cut down unnecessary time waste for less

                After using GitHub for a while, we all realized the benefits and
                advantages of GitHub and understand why
                most IT professionals and systems use GitHub to organize their
                projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, GitHub helps us store our source code and files
                like cloud storage like Google Drive or
                OneDrive,... This is convenient because as a team project, we
                all work on the same file and use the same
                documents so storing it in the same directory makes it easier
                for all of us to find and use any files of the
                project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, except the storing function, the audit trail helps us
                keep track of what is going on. We can
                easily know who edited this file, who created another file,...
                and most importantly, all the previous
                versions of a file will be saved so that if we make any
                mistakes, we can turn back to the old version of
                that file. This is extremely important in IT in general, because
                in a large project, for example a mobile
                app project, we have many functions in a project and we can not
                finish it in 1 day and we have to work for
                days, months or even years. In that long period of time,
                mistakes will be made and sometimes we have to turn
                back where we started. That is why GitHub is so useful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those benefits really affect our productivity. We can track
                others' progress using GitHub. We saved time by
                turning back to the working version and not affecting the whole
                project by a mistake.

                            Concerns regarding nutritional imbalances and the
                            growth in obesity rates are widespread. In
                            1985, no U.S. state had obesity rates higher than
                            15%, and by 2016, no state had rates lower
                            than 20%, according to Shattuck (2017). The global
                            obesity rate is currently around 33% [1]. It
                            goes without saying that society will gain from
                            addressing nutritional imbalances. Obesity is on
                            the rise while physical activity rates have fallen
                            (Skinner et al., 2018, cited in Armstrong,
                            2019) [2]. This regulation applies to all IT
                            professionals. People who eschew outdoor activities
                            and spend a lot of time sitting still are more
                            likely to be overweight or obese.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result, the subject of nutritional imbalance
                            caught our group's attention. One of the most
                            popular and useful ways to quantify obesity is via
                            BMI. People can readily ascertain their
                            current physical condition by dividing their weight
                            by their height square. Our team found
                            issues with various BMI calculators. This was the
                            problem with merely providing the essential
                            information, such as the current condition and
                            statistics. Our group felt that it would be more
                            useful to make recommendations for the forms of
                            management that are necessary in addition to BMI
                            calculation. We therefore decided to create a
                            calculator that eliminates the need for users to
                            check their BMI, look up workouts online, or locate
                            a different calculator in order to determine
                            how many calories they consumed today. Our
                            technology allows users to calculate their daily
                            calorie intake and receive recommendations depending
                            on their BMI. Users can use this to
                            generally determine if they should raise their diet,
                            exercise more, or lower their diet.

                            After the COVID-19 pandemic and a long period of
                            working from home, people started realizing how
                            important it is to be healthy, both physically and
                            mentally. Based on that realization, we came
                            up with the idea of a virtual assistant for health
                            care. This project can change the habits of
                            the majority of people about their awareness of
                            their health and help people have a better and
                            healthier life.

                        <p>
                            Smartphones have become an indispensable part of our
                            lives in the past 20 years; everything now
                            can be accessed easily using smartphones, from
                            payment, transportation, socialization,... That
                            is why we came up with a cross-platform mobile
                            virtual assistant that is available on your
                            mobile devices such as smartphones, laptops,
                            tablets,... We believe that the trend of mobile
                            applications will last for many years, and even when
                            augmented reality and virtual reality
                            become popular in the near future, it will be an
                            opportunity for us to make our virtual
                            assistant more "realistic."

                            This project is not just a "school project" or
                            normal group project. This project is a
                            replication of real-life IT-related projects. As a
                            result, working on this project brings us
                            many benefits. Firstly, we have a chance to work in
                            a professional environment. We do documents
                            like proposals, reports, meeting minutes, papers,
                            etc.; we do academic research for our project
                            idea; we have to obey different work ethics from the
                            normal projects. Secondly, we learn how to
                            work effectively in a group, a department, or
                            something similar. We learn how to stay in touch
                            with people, teammates, and other departments; we
                            learn how to communicate professionally;... In
                            conclusion, there are many invisible benefits that
                            we can gain from working on a project, like
                            technical skills and knowledge aside from
                            professional workflow. This is a good opportunity
                            for
                            us to prove to the employers that we can fit into
                            their business.

                            Our project idea is not highly distinguishable from
                            those on the market. There are many similar
                            products with similar functions to ours. We chose
                            two products that already exist to give an
                            overview of similar products:
                        </p>

                            <li>Nike Training Club is a fitness app from Nike,

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Both products mentioned above have almost the same
                            features as our apps. But these products are
                            consistently receiving bad reviews because of a bad
                            user experience. The common problems of the
                            competitors are:
                        </p>

                                useless.</li>
                            <li>The programs provided are too general and not
                                personalized enough for every user.</li>
                            <li>The User Interface of the app is not attractive
                                and easy-to-use.</li>
                            <li>Most of the time, the users will feel “lonely”
                                because the assistant they have is not really
                                an assistant.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Understanding the users’ problems, our aim is to
                            solve all the problems mentioned above. Besides
                            providing programs through computer calculation and
                            maybe AI in the far future, we are planning
                            to provide a platform to connect trainers and users.
                            This feature will make our product more
                            user-friendly and customizable. Furthermore, we are
                            focusing on developing UX and UI together so
                            as to make the app more easy-to-use and attractive.

                            that we mentioned above, we can easily
                            define our most important aim for this project:</p>
                        <h4 style="text-align: center;">A “real” virtual trainer</h4>
                        <p>
                            Being fit and healthy does not mean that you have to
                            work hard like a real body builder. They
                            are usually simple exercises done at home, such as a
                            morning trek in a nearby park, but you may
                            occasionally lose your track; you may not know where
                            to begin or continue your track. This is
                            when a virtual trainer comes in handy. A virtual
                            trainer not only provides you with a training
                            program but also tracks your progress, giving you
                            personalized advice based on your real status.

                        <p>
                            In order to be a “real” virtual trainer, we have
                            defined some goals for our process of
                            development:
                        </p>

                                <p>
                                    For us, UI is one of the most important
                                    parts of a mobile app's success. An
                                    attractive
                                    and energetic UI is a big motivation for our
                                    users. Looking at and using an app that is
                                    colorful and motivating gives our users more
                                    encouragement to work out and stay healthy.
                                </p>

                                    Building a system that has a good user
                                    experience is a big challenge for every
                                    project.
                                    There are two main points on which we will

                                An early prototype to demonstrate the
                                operation of the app helps us analyze the pros
                                and cons of the project so that we can make
                                adjustments before further stages. The purpose
                                of this phase is to save human resources and
                                time.

                            <li>Basically, testers are people who act like a
                                real user using our software and try to find
                                all the errors of that software before

                                assistants. These people are assigned specific
                                work
                                from the upper department and they follow that

                            <li>The reason why these people are important is
                                because there is some simple work that does not
                                require any specialized knowledge and these
                                people help us save time on those work. This
                                helps efficient human resources.</li>

                <p>
                    Our group made an effort not to have a big bug or problem after the release. We expected that finding and resolving bugs during the development process would increase development and operational efficiency rather than creating bugs after our project was released. We referred to the "Agile development cycle" to make thorough software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "Agile development cycle" was chosen by our group because it necessitates continuous interaction and debugging.In addition, these short-period interactions will allow all our team members to participate in the debugging process continuously, thereby enhancing the overall team members' understanding of the project and ensuring that they do not forget the progress of the project. This cycle aims to be implemented whenever there are new changes or functional additions to our website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made it a requirement to distinguish whether our test was successful or unsuccessful. We provide an example of the requirements (expected results) of the website by referring to the behavior-driven development (BDD) model. The definitions in these dictionaries aim to be as clear and objective as possible to reduce confusion. As a result, these conditions (expected results) aim to help provide the tester with clear acceptance criteria.
