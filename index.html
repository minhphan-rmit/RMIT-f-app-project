                F-APP is short for Fitness App. We came up with this name randomly in a past meeting, it meets our
                criteria: as few syllables as possible and easy to remember. But we are planning to have an alternative
                name for the project product that is more meaningful and memorable also.

                So far, we have been working on this project for 2 months. Everything is still in control. Even though
                we missed some of our deadlines, we are trying our best to cut down unnecessary time waste for less
                important tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our connection between members is great, we work together smoothly, or at least no conflicts at the
                moment. We often meet for important tasks such as presentations, finalizing reports,... Besides, we keep
                our connection through Messenger and Canvas.

                    I considered myself as a practical and logical person. That is why I am planning to study 2 minors:
                    Data Analytics and Cloud Technology. After graduation, I will apply for 2 positions based on my
                    minors: Cloud Engineer or Data Analyst. These entry-level jobs will bring me opportunities in
                    working in big companies so that I can gain experience in a professional system. After that, I have
                    two plans for myself. If I get promoted and get a better position or job, I will stick to that job
                    and develop myself further. Otherwise, I want to start my own business after taking an MBA in the
                    future.

                    As a student of the Bachelor of Information Technology, I believe that I would have a good
                    background as well as a better beginning than others when I have a job in the future. The RMIT
                    education and my passion for IT might help me have a lot of opportunities in the future including
                    taking part in a technology multinational company or being a leader of a big project for my host
                    company. When working in a big group, in my opinion, I wish I could contribute all my skills and
                    knowledge, and learn new things and experiences from others, especially people from other parts of
                    the world. After working for a long time and getting enough experience, I might run my own business
                    and I will try my best to reach my dream. If I succeed, I can do another job such as becoming a
                    singer to make a variety of income for my life.

                        Numerous people are concerned about nutritional imbalance and the rise in obesity rates.
                        According to Shattuck (2017), obesity rates did not exceed 15% in any U.S. state in 1985, and by
                        2016 no state had a rate under 20%. Currently, the average obesity rate is over 33%[1]. It is
                        obvious that correcting dietary imbalances will benefit society. As rates of physical activity
                        have decreased, there is an increasing epidemic of obesity (Skinner et al., 2018, cited in
                        Armstrong, 2019)[2].. IT professionals are not exempt from this rule. In particular, persons who
                        spend several hours sitting in chairs and avoid outdoor activities are more likely to be exposed
                        to obesity or underweight risks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, our group developed an interest in the topic of nutritional imbalance. BMI is one
                        of the well-known and practical measurements of obesity. By dividing one's weight by the square
                        of height, individuals can quickly determine their present physical state. Our group identified
                        shortcomings in other BMI calculators. This was the issue with only giving out the basic
                        necessities of data, such as the present situation and statistics. Our group believed that it
                        would be more practical if it offered suggestions as to what types of management are required
                        beyond just calculating BMI. Therefore, we made the decision to develop a calculator that does
                        not require users to check their BMI, search for exercises online, or find another calculator to
                        see how many calories they consumed today. Users can calculate their daily caloric intake and
                        receive suggestions depending on their BMI using our project. This allows users to know roughly
                        whether they should reduce their diet, exercise, or increase their diet.

                        After the Covid-19 pandemic and a long period of work-from-home, people started realizing how
                        important it is to be healthy both physically and mentally. Based on that realization, we came
                        up with the idea of a virtual assistant for health care. This project can change the habits of
                        the majority of people about their awareness about their health, and help people have a better
                        and healthy life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Smartphones have become an indispensable part of our life in the past 20 years, everything now
                        can be accessed easily using smartphones from payment, transportation, socialization,... That is
                        why we came up with a cross-platform mobile virtual assistant that is available on your mobile
                        devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets,... We believe that the trend of mobile
                        applications will last for many years or even when Augmented reality and Virtual reality become
                        popular in the near future, it will be an opportunity for us to make our virtual assistant more
                        “realistic”.

                        This project is not just a “school project” or normal group project. This project is the
                        replication of real-life IT related projects. As a result, working in this project brings us
                        many benefits. Firstly, we have a chance to work in a professional environment. We do documents
                        like proposals, reports, meeting minutes, papers,...; we do academic research for our project
                        idea; we have to obey different work ethics from the normal projects. Secondly, we learn how to
                        work effectively in a group, a department or something similar. We learn how to keep in touch
                        with people, teammates and other departments; we learn how to make professional
                        communications;... In conclusion, there are many invisible benefits that we can gain from
                        working in a project like technical skills and knowledge besides professional workflow. This
                        makes a good opportunity for us to prove ourselves to the employers that we can fit in their
                        business.

                        Our project idea is not highly distinguishable from the market. There are many similar products
                        with similar functions with our product. We chose 2 products that already exist to give an
                        overview about similar products:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nike Training Club is a fitness app from Nike, Inc.</li>
                        <li>We Do Pulse is a personal health assistant made by PULSE ECOSYSTEM PTE. LTD.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Both products mentioned above have almost the same features as our apps. But these products are
                        consistently receiving bad reviews because of bad user experience. Common problems of the
                        competitors are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The free plans and programs are completely useless.</li>
                        <li>The programs provided are too general and not personalized enough for every user.</li>
                        <li>The User Interface of the app is not attractive and easy-to-use.</li>
                        <li>Most of the time, the users will feel “lonely” because the assistant they have is not really
                            an assistant.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Understanding the users’ problems, our aim is to solve all the problems mentioned above. Besides
                        providing programs by computer calculation and maybe AI in the far future, we are planning to
                        provide a platform to connect trainers and users. This feature will make our product more
                        user-friendly and more customizable. Furthermore, we are focusing on developing UX and UI
                        together so as to make the app more easy-to-use and attractive.

                <div>
                    <p>Based on the disadvantages of other similar products that we mentioned above, we can easily
                        define our most important aim for this project:</p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: center;">A “real” virtual trainer</h4>
                    <p>
                        Being fit and healthy does not mean that you have to work hard like a real body builder.
                        Usually, they are simple exercises at home, a morning trekking in your nearby park, … But
                        sometimes, you may lose your track, you don’t know where to start or continue your track. This
                        is when a virtual trainer comes in handy. A virtual trainer not only provides you a training
                        program but also tracks your progress, giving you personalized advice based on your real status.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to be a “real” virtual trainer, we have defined some goals for our process of
                        development:
                    </p>

                            <p>
                                For us, UI is one of the most important parts of a mobile app's success. An attractive
                                and energetic UI is a big motivation for our users. Looking and using an app that is
                                colorful and motivating gives our users more encouragement to work out and stay healthy.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Building a system that has good user experience is a big challenge for every project.
                                There are two main points that we will focus on the UX of our product: simplify the way
                                of using the app by easing the connection between users and trainers; personalize the
                                app as much as possible for every user so that they will feel cared and motivated.
