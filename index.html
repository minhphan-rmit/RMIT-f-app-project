                <h3>Topic</h3>
                <p>
                    Numerous people are concerned about nutritional imbalance and the rise in obesity rates. According to Shattuck (2017), obesity rates did not exceed 15% in any U.S. state in 1985, and by 2016 no state had a rate under 20%. Currently, the average obesity rate is over 33%[1]. It is obvious that correcting dietary imbalances will benefit society.

                <p>
                    As rates of physical activity have decreased, there is an increasing epidemic of obesity (Skinner et al., 2018, cited in Armstrong, 2019)[2].. IT professionals are not exempt from this rule. In particular, persons who spend several hours sitting in chairs and avoid outdoor activities are more likely to be exposed to obesity or underweight risks.

                <p>
                    As a result, our group developed an interest in the topic of nutritional imbalance. BMI is one of the well-known and practical measurements of obesity. By dividing one's weight by the square of height, individuals can quickly determine their present physical state. Our group identified shortcomings in other BMI calculators. This was the issue with only giving out the basic necessities of data, such as the present situation and statistics. Our group believed that it would be more practical if it offered suggestions as to what types of management are required beyond just calculating BMI. Therefore, we made the decision to develop a calculator that does not require users to check their BMI, search for exercises online, or find another calculator to see how many calories they consumed today. Users can calculate their daily caloric intake and receive suggestions depending on their BMI using our project. This allows users to know roughly whether they should reduce their diet, exercise, or increase their diet.

                <p>
                    After the Covid-19 pandemic and a long period of work-from-home, people started realizing how important it is to be healthy both physically and mentally. Based on that realization, we came up with the idea of a virtual assistant for health care. This project can change the habits of the majority of people about their awareness about their health, and help people have a better and healthy life.

                    Smartphones have become an indispensable part of our life in the past 20 years, everything now can be accessed easily using smartphones from payment, transportation, socialization,... That is why we came up with a cross-platform mobile virtual assistant that is available on your mobile devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets,... We believe that the trend of mobile applications will last for many years or even when Augmented reality and Virtual reality become popular in the near future, it will be an opportunity for us to make our virtual assistant more “realistic”.

                    This project is not just a “school project” or normal group project. This project is the replication of real-life IT related projects. As a result, working in this project brings us many benefits. Firstly, we have a chance to work in a professional environment. We do documents like proposals, reports, meeting minutes, papers,...; we do academic research for our project idea; we have to obey different work ethics from the normal projects. Secondly, we learn how to work effectively in a group, a department or something similar. We learn how to keep in touch with people, teammates and other departments; we learn how to make professional communications;... In conclusion, there are many invisible benefits that we can gain from working in a project like technical skills and knowledge besides professional workflow. This makes a good opportunity for us to prove ourselves to the employers that we can fit in their business.
