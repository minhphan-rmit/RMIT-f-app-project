                        “I am Minh Phan. I am 100% Saigonese because I was born in Ho Chi Minh City and have lived here for 18 years. I have been interested in IT since I was three years old. I tried to get into the IT specialized high school class but failed the test. From that moment, my IT passion went down. However, when I was thinking about my university major, IT just popped up again, which is why I am studying IT at RMIT. I am logical and practical (my personality type is INTP), and I also like math. That is why I think IT is suitable for me. Besides the enjoyment of working with computers, I do enjoy how IT is helping to develop our life. For example, smart homes are an application of IT technologies, making our lives easier. Personally, there are two reasons why I am interested in this topic/project. First, I want to experience working on a team project that follows professional criteria. Second, the idea quite suits my needs. I am trying to balance studying and being healthy simultaneously, so I need the project’s outcome. I am a practical and logical person. That is why I am planning to study two minors: Data Analytics and Cloud Technology. After graduation, I will apply for two positions based on my minors: Cloud Engineer and Data Analyst. These entry-level jobs will give me opportunities to work for big companies so that I can gain experience in a professional setting. After that, I have two plans for myself. If I get promoted and get a better position or job, I will stick to that job and develop myself further. Otherwise, I want to start my own business after taking an MBA."

I have learned Python, C, and R programming and have coding and computing thinking advantages. I have experienced losing 20 kg through dieting, and I am still on a diet. I do running and weight training every day as a hobby, and I am glad that this hobby fits well with the direction of our project. I set three main goals for this project. Firstly, I want to use my strengths and experiences to create an HTML website. Secondly, I look forward to creating a high-accuracy F-APP website by synthesizing and analyzing fitness data from various users, other calculation sites, and papers. Lastly, I hope that the development process and results of F-APP will positively affect my diet. I have always wanted to run a company that makes electronic devices. I have long been interested in high-tech electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and VR. In particular, I liked to compare their strengths and weaknesses and analyze which are more competitive and why some products are famous and less popular. These hobbies and interests naturally led me to be interested in big data and data analytics, which mine and analyze valuable data among numerous user data. Before running a company, it was essential to understand the process and strategy of Big Tech companies planning, producing, and selling their products. RMIT University provides internships for many global companies, so I chose the data analysis minor at RMIT University's IT department. I have to study for an internship at RMIT University and have experience in the IT field, then go back to Korea and join the army. I will apply for a software developer position to continue my IT experience while in the military. This experience is expected to help me make contact with the rapidly changing IT sector without wasting time in the military. After discharge from the military, I aim to start my own business after gaining more practical experience in IT companies."

My parents and I decided to study at RMIT University because we believed I could have a better academic background after graduating and more opportunities to participate in good companies. Since I was a child, I have fallen in love with music, and my dream is to become a music composer and singer. However, when I grew up, I realized that I could not make money with my talent; as a result, I decided to learn as a student in the Bachelor of Information Technology course at RMIT. Although I do not have any experience in IT, I believe that RMIT could train me and make me a better version. As a student of the Bachelor of Information Technology, I will have a good background as well as a better start than others when I have a job in the future. The RMIT education and my passion for IT might help me have many opportunities in the future, including taking part in a technology multinational company or being a leader of a big project for my host company. When working in a large group, I want to contribute all my skills and knowledge and learn new things and experiences from others, especially people from other parts of the world. After working for a long time and getting enough experience, I might run my own business and try my best to reach my dream. If I succeed, I can do another job, such as becoming a singer, to make a variety of income for my life."

                        “I am fascinated by the performance of the already available AI on the market, like Siri or Google Assistant, when it comes to human interaction. Their possible room for improvement has led me to major in IT and choose AI as my minor. However, with little prior insight into the field, I still have much to learn, and I am eager to do so. One of my advantages is that I am open to new experiences, knowledge and opinion. However, sometimes I tend to over-complicate things, which has led to multiple difficulties during my time in school, and it is something I am working on to improve myself. Technology, in general, has been one of my top interests since I was a child. Furthermore, information technology has recently proven itself to be the "next big thing," the core foundation of the fourth industrial revolution. This has struck me as an unmissable chance to pursue something I enjoy while making a living. With that in mind, in high school, I put effort into laying the bedrock for it by familiarizing myself with primary coding language and critical thinking. On that groundwork, I intend to further improve my skill and knowledge of the field during my time at RMIT university while actively seeking hand-ons experience in the form of internship via the school broad connection as well as building beneficial relationships with my peers, developing professional practices required for my future career as an IT officer, etc. I believe it is every IT student's dream to work for one of the "Four Horsemen" of tech after their graduation, myself included, and be a part of the force that drives the world forward or just make a fortune out of it. Alternatively, even better, join them as the "Fifth" one."

            <p>
                After using GitHub for a while, we all realized the benefits and advantages of GitHub and understood why most IT professionals and systems use GitHub to organize their projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, GitHub helps us store our source code and files like cloud storage like Google Drive or OneDrive. This feature is convenient because, as a team project, we all work on the same file and use the same documents, so storing it in the same directory makes it easier for all of us to find and use any files of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, besides the storing function, the audit trail helps us keep track of what is happening. We can quickly know who edited this file and who created another file. Furthermore, most importantly, all the previous versions of a file will be saved so that if we make any mistakes, we can turn back to the old version of that file. The audit trail is essential in IT in general because in a large project, for example, a mobile app project, we have many functions, and we can not finish it in 1 day, and we have to work for days, months or even years. In that long period, mistakes will be made, and sometimes, we have to turn back where we started. That is why GitHub is so helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those benefits affect our productivity. We can track others' progress using GitHub. We saved time by turning back to the working version and not affecting the whole project by mistake.

                    <p>
                        Numerous people are concerned about nutritional imbalance and the rise in obesity rates. According to Shattuck (2017), obesity rates did not exceed 15% in any U.S. state in 1985; by 2016, no state had a rate under 20%. Currently, the average obesity rate is over 33%. Correcting dietary imbalances will benefit society. As rates of physical activity have decreased, there is an increasing epidemic of obesity (Skinner et al., 2018, cited in Armstrong, 2019). IT professionals are not exempt from this rule. In particular, persons who spend several hours sitting in chairs and avoid outdoor activities are more likely to be exposed to obesity or underweight risks.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, our group developed an interest in the topic of nutritional imbalance. BMI is one of the well-known and practical measurements of obesity. Individuals can quickly determine their present physical state by dividing one's weight by the square of height. Our group identified areas for improvement in other BMI calculators. This was the issue with only giving out the necessities of data, such as the present situation and statistics. Our group believed it would be more practical if it offered suggestions as to what types of management are required beyond just calculating BMI. Therefore, we decided to develop a calculator that does not require users to check their BMI, search for exercises online, or find another calculator to see how many calories they consumed today. Using our project, users can calculate their daily caloric intake and receive suggestions depending on their BMI. This lets users know whether they should reduce their diet, exercise, or increase their diet.

                        After the COVID-19 pandemic and a long period of working from home, people started realizing how important it is to be physically and mentally healthy. Based on that realization, we developed a virtual assistant for health care. This project can change the habits of the majority of people about their awareness of their health and help people have a better and healthier life.

                    <p>
                        Smartphones have become an indispensable part of our lives in the past 20 years; we can easily access services using smartphones, from payment, transportation and socialization. That is why we developed a cross-platform virtual assistant available on mobile devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets. The trend of mobile applications will last for many years. Even when augmented reality and virtual reality become popular soon, it will be an opportunity for us to make our product more "realistic."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project is not just a "school project" or an average group project. This project is a replication of real-life IT-related projects. As a result, working on this project brings us many benefits. Firstly, we have a chance to work in a professional environment. We do documents like proposals, reports, meeting minutes, and papers. We do academic research for our project idea; we have to obey different work ethics from the typical projects. Secondly, we learn how to work effectively in a group, a department, or similar. We learn how to stay in touch with people, teammates, and other departments; we learn how to communicate professionally. In conclusion, we can gain many invisible benefits from working on a project, like technical skills and knowledge aside from professional workflow. This is an excellent opportunity to prove to employers that we can fit into their business.

                        Our project idea is not highly distinguishable from those on the market. There are many similar products with similar functions to ours. We chose two products that already exist to give an overview of similar products:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nike Training Club is a fitness app from Nike, Inc.</li>
                        <li>We Do Pulse is a personal health assistant made by PULSE ECOSYSTEM PTE. LTD.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Both products mentioned above have almost the same features as our apps. However, these products consistently receive bad reviews because of a bad user experience. The common problems of the competitors are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The free plans and programs could be more helpful.</li>
                        <li>The programs provided need to be more general and personalized for every user.</li>
                        <li>The app's user interface could be more attractive and easy to use.</li>
                        <li>Most of the time, the users will feel "lonely" because their assistant is not really an assistant.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Based on users' needs, we aim to solve all the abovementioned problems. Besides providing programs through computer calculation and AI in the future, we plan to provide a platform to connect trainers and users. This feature will make our product more user-friendly and customizable. Furthermore, we are focusing on developing UX and UI together to make the app more easy-to-use and attractive.

                <h3>Aims</h3>
                <div class="text-paragraph">
                    <p>
                        Based on the disadvantages of other similar products that we mentioned above, we can easily define our most important aim for this project:
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: center;">A “real” virtual trainer</h4>
                    <p>
                        Being fit and healthy does not mean that you have to work hard like a natural bodybuilder. They are usually simple exercises at home, such as a morning trek in a nearby park, but you may occasionally lose your track; you may need help knowing where to begin or continue your track. This is when a virtual trainer comes in handy. A virtual trainer provides a training program and tracks your progress, giving personalized advice based on your status.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to be a "real" virtual trainer, we have defined some goals for our process of development:
                    </p>
                    <!--Goals-->
                    <div>
                        <!--Goal 1-->
                        <div>
                            <h4>The most attractive UI</h4>
                            <p>
                                For us, UI is one of the essential parts of a mobile app's success. An attractive and energetic UI is a big motivation for our users. Looking at and using a colorful and motivating app encourages our users to work out and stay healthy.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <!--Goal 2-->
                        <div>
                            <h4>The best UX</h4>
                            <p>
                                Building a system that has a good user experience is a big challenge for every project. There are two main points on which we will focus on the UX of our product: simplify the way of using the app by easing the connection between users and trainers, and personalize the app as much as possible for every user so that they will feel cared for and motivated.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <!--Goal 3-->
                        <div>
                            <h4>Verified trainers</h4>
                            <p>
                                Our product is not only for users who want to stay healthy but also for trainers who are passionate about bodybuilding and willing to share their knowledge to help others stay healthy. This will help them develop their passion and provide a source of income.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Besides the aim of the product, that aim sounds a bit "technical," we have another aim that is more "social," and this is as important as the aim mentioned above:
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: center;">A healthy community (F-APP community)</h4>
                    <p>
                        When the app gets released to the market, it will not only help every user individually, but it will be a platform that connects people, helps people make friends, share their progress, and helps others reach their goals. This will affect society's awareness about their health, creating a healthier, more connected society.
                    </p>

                            An early prototype to demonstrate the
                            operation of the app helps us analyze the pros
                            and cons of the project so that we can make
                            adjustments before further stages. The purpose
                            of this phase is to save human resources and
                            time.

                            market, and any technical or human resources that should be cut down to operate the project

                        <li>A UI designer's job is to design the visual look of the software.</li>
                        <li>A UX designer's job is to design the way the software works (for example, the chat box
                            between the user and trainer must be eye-catching and visible so that the user can easily
                            access the app functions without complicated and tedious instructions)
                        </li>

                        <li>This is one of the most critical departments of the project because it helps the team manage

                        <li>These people are essential because some simple work does not require specialized knowledge,
                            and these people help us save time on those work. This helps efficient human resources.</li>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Our group tried avoiding a giant bug or problem after the release. We expected that finding and
                resolving bugs in the development process would increase development and operational efficiency rather
                than creating bugs after our project releases. We referred to "AGILE DEVELOPMENT CYCLE" to make specific
                software.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason why our group decided to use the "AGILE DEVELOPMENT CYCLE" is that it requires continuous and
                continuous interaction and debugging. In addition, these short-period interactions will allow all our
                team members to participate continuously in the debugging process, enhancing their understanding of the
                project and ensuring that they remember the project's progress. This cycle should be implemented
                whenever there are new changes or functionality additions to our website.
            </p>
            <p>
                We made a requirement to distinguish whether our test was successful or unsuccessful. We provide an
                example of the website's requirements (expected results) by referring to the Behavior-driven development
                (BDD) model. The defined conditions of these dictionaries aim to be as clear and objective as possible
                to reduce confusion. As a result, these conditions (expected results) aim to help provide the tester
                with clear acceptance criteria.
