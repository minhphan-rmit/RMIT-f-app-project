                        "IT has fascinated me since I was three years old. I failed the entrance exam for the
                        specialized high school IT class. From that point on, my interest in IT diminished. However,
                        while considering my university major, IT resurfaced, which is why I am majoring in IT at RMIT.
                        I am analytical and practical (INTP personality type), and I like mathematics. Therefore, IT is
                        suited to my needs. In addition to my delight in working with computers, I appreciate how IT
                        contributes to improving our lives. This topic/project is intriguing to me for two reasons.
                        First, I want to participate in a team project that adheres to professional standards. Second,
                        the concept meets my requirements. I am attempting to study and maintain a healthy lifestyle
                        concurrently; thus, I need the project's product."

I do run and weight training every day as a hobby, and I am glad that this hobby fits well with the direction of our project. I set three main goals for this project. Firstly, I want to use my strengths and experiences to create an HTML website. Secondly, I look forward to creating a high-accuracy F-APP website by synthesizing and analyzing fitness data from various users, other calculation sites, and papers. Lastly, I hope that the development process and results of F-APP will positively affect my diet."

These hobbies and interests naturally led me to be interested in big data and data analytics, which analyze and mine valuable data among numerous user data. Currently, I am studying IT field at RMIT. However, I must go back to Korea and join the army. I will apply for a software developer position to continue my IT experience while in the military.

                            "Technology, in general, has been one of my top interests since I was a child. Furthermore,
                            IT has recently proven itself to be the "next big thing," the core foundation of the fourth
                            industrial revolution. This has struck me as an unmissable chance to pursue something I
                            enjoy while making a living. With that in mind, in high school, I put effort into laying the
                            bedrock for it by familiarizing myself with primary coding language and critical thinking.
                            On that groundwork, I intend further to improve my skill and knowledge of the field while at
                            RMIT university. While actively seeking hands-on experience in the form of an internship via
                            the school's broad connections, as well as building beneficial relationships with my peers
                            and developing professional practices required for my future career as an IT officer. I
                            believe it is every IT student's dream to work for one of the "Four Horsemen" of tech after
                            their graduation, myself included, and be a part of the force that drives the world forward
                            or just make a fortune out of it. Alternatively, even better, join them as the "Fifth" one."

                After using it for some time, we discovered the benefits and advantages of GitHub. We recognized why

                The audit trail is one of the functions that significantly influences our productivity and workflow.
                Version control enables us to safeguard our project by preventing it from being harmed by errors. If
                there are any issues with the new features, version control allows us to revert to the prior version,
                which is functional and does not impact the whole project.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the commitments log allows us to represent the contributions of each team member. Using
                GitHub, it is simple to monitor the development of other team members. By monitoring the progress of
                others, we may prevent missing deadlines, which significantly influences our entire performance.

                        Numerous people are concerned about nutritional imbalance and the rise in obesity rates.
                        According to Shattuck (2017), obesity rates did not exceed 15% in any U.S. state in 1985; by
                        2016, no state had a rate under 20%. Currently, the average obesity rate is over 33%. Correcting
                        dietary imbalances will benefit society.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As rates of physical activity have decreased, there is an increasing epidemic of obesity
                        (Skinner et al., 2018, cited in Armstrong, 2019). IT professionals are not exempt from this
                        rule. In particular, persons who spend several hours sitting in chairs and avoid outdoor
                        activities are more likely to be exposed to obesity or underweight risks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, our group developed an interest in the topic of nutritional imbalance. BMI is one
                        of the well-known and practical measurements of obesity. Individuals can quickly determine their
                        present physical state by dividing one's weight by the square of height. Our group identified
                        areas for improvement in other BMI calculators. This was the issue with only giving out the
                        necessities of data, such as the present situation and statistics. Our group believed it would
                        be more practical if it offered suggestions as to what types of management are required beyond
                        just calculating BMI. Therefore, we decided to develop a calculator that does not need users to
                        check their BMI, search for exercises online, or find another calculator to see how many
                        calories they consumed today. Using our project, users can calculate their daily caloric intake
                        and receive suggestions depending on their BMI. This lets users know whether they should reduce
                        their diet, exercise, or increase their diet.

                        After the COVID-19 pandemic and a long period of working from home, people started realizing how
                        important it is to be physically and mentally healthy. Based on that realization, we developed a
                        virtual assistant for health care. This project can change the habits of the majority of people
                        about their awareness of their health and help people have a better and healthier life.

                        Smartphones have become indispensable in our lives in the past 20 years; we can easily access
                        smartphone services, from payment to transportation and socialization. That is why we developed
                        a cross-platform virtual assistant available on mobile devices such as smartphones, laptops, and
                        tablets. The trend of mobile applications will last for many years. Even when augmented reality
                        and virtual reality become popular soon, it will be an opportunity for us to make our product
                        more "realistic."

                    <p>
                        This project is not just a "school project" or an average group project. This project is a
                        replication of real-life IT-related projects. As a result, working on this project brings us
                        many benefits. Firstly, we have a chance to work in a professional environment. We do documents
                        like proposals, reports, meeting minutes, and papers. We do academic research for our project
                        idea; we have to obey different work ethics from the typical projects. Secondly, we learn how to
                        work effectively in a group, a department, or similar. We learn how to stay in touch with
                        people, teammates, and other departments; we learn how to communicate professionally. In
                        conclusion, we can gain many invisible benefits from working on a project, like technical skills
                        and knowledge aside from professional workflow. This is an excellent opportunity to prove to
                        employers that we can fit into their business.

                        Our project idea is not highly distinguishable from those on the market. There are many similar
                        products with similar functions to ours. We chose two products that already exist to give an
                        overview of similar products:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nike Training Club is a fitness app from Nike, Inc.</li>
                        <li>We Do Pulse is a personal health assistant made by PULSE ECOSYSTEM PTE. LTD.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Both products mentioned above have almost the same features as our apps. However, these products
                        consistently receive bad reviews because of a bad user experience. The common problems of the
                        competitors are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The free plans and programs could be more helpful.</li>
                        <li>The programs provided need to be more general and personalized for every user.</li>
                        <li>The app's user interface could be more attractive and easy to use.</li>
                        <li>Most of the time, the users will feel "lonely" because their assistant is not really an
                            assistant.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Based on users' needs, we aim to solve all the abovementioned problems. Besides providing
                        programs through computer calculation and AI in the future, we plan to provide a platform to
                        connect trainers and users. This feature will make our product more user-friendly and
                        customizable. Furthermore, we are focusing on developing UX and UI together to make the app more
                        easy-to-use and attractive.

                    <p>
                        Based on the disadvantages of other similar products that we mentioned above, we can easily
                        define our most important aim for this project:
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: center;">A “real” virtual trainer</h4>
                    <p>
                        Being fit and healthy does not mean that you have to work hard like a natural bodybuilder. They
                        are usually simple exercises at home, such as a morning trek in a nearby park, but you may
                        occasionally lose your track; you may need help knowing where to begin or continue your track.
                        In such a situation, a virtual trainer is helpful. A virtual trainer delivers a training
                        regimen, monitors your progress, and gives individualized feedback depending on your status.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to be a "real" virtual trainer, we have defined some goals for our process of
                        development:
                    </p>
                    <!--Goals-->
                    <div>
                        <!--Goal 1-->
                        <div>
                            <h4>The most attractive UI</h4>
                            <p>
                                For us, UI is one of the essential parts of a mobile app's success. An attractive and
                                energetic UI is a big motivation for our users. Looking at and using a colorful and
                                motivating app encourages our users to work out and stay healthy.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <!--Goal 2-->
                        <div>
                            <h4>The best UX</h4>
                            <p>
                                Building a system that has a good user experience is a big challenge for every project.
                                There are two main points on which we will focus on the UX of our product: simplify the
                                way of using the app by easing the connection between users and trainers, and
                                personalize the app as much as possible for every user so that they will feel cared for
                                and motivated.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <!--Goal 3-->
                        <div>
                            <h4>Verified trainers</h4>
                            <p>
                                Our product is not only for users who want to stay healthy but also for trainers who are
                                passionate about bodybuilding and willing to share their knowledge to help others stay
                                healthy. This will help them develop their passion and provide a source of income.

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Besides the aim of the product, that aim sounds a bit "technical," we have another aim that is
                        more "social," and this is as important as the aim mentioned above:
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="text-align: center;">A healthy community (F-APP community)</h4>
                    <p>
                        When the app gets released to the market, it will not only help every user individually, but it
                        will be a platform that connects people, helps people make friends, share their progress, and
                        helps others reach their goals. This will affect society's awareness about their health,
                        creating a healthier, more connected society.

                            Every IT-related project never ends. Ours is not an exception. After release, we will keep
                            getting users' feedback and make improvements. Besides, more new functions will be added to
                            the product, and existing functions will be improved. Furthermore, our product can be turned
                            into a cross-platform application or a company, an "empire" of fitness.

                        <li>UI and UX are two different roles, but as a new project and our product are in the early
                            development phases, merging these roles helps us save human resources and expenses.</li>
                        <li>A UI designer's job is to design the visual look of the software.</li>
                        <li>A UX designer's job is to design the way the software works (for example, the chat box
                            between the user and trainer must be eye-catching and visible so that the user can easily
                            access the app functions without complicated and tedious instructions)

                        <li>QA acts like real users using our software and tries to find all the errors of that software
                            before releasing it.</li>
                        <li>This is one of the most critical departments of the project because it helps the team manage

                            from the upper department, and they follow that assignment.</li>
                        <li>These people are essential because some simple work does not require specialized knowledge,
                            and these people help us save time on those work. This helps efficient human resources.</li>

                    This project is about developing a cross-platform application that requires a large combination of
                    tools and technologies to develop the product. We divided the products into groups based on their
                    purpose (or group of tasks):

                        Google Cloud and other Google products are mainly for making documents like reports, meeting
                        minutes and presentation scripts and storing those documents on the cloud. GitHub is for storing
                        and a shared workspace for source code from the application and group’s website also.

                        UI and UX are critical parts of our project, so choosing the right tools is essential. For
                        graphics, we use <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>. These
                        are the most popular design tools
                        right now on the market, so there is no doubt that these are the right tools for designing
                        graphics for the UI. There is an alternative tool that we found beneficial recently -
                        <strong>Figma</strong>.
                        From the graphics above, we need a tool that combines all the graphics into the actual interface
                        for the app; our choice is <strong>Adobe XD</strong>. <strong>Adobe XD</strong> is the tool for
                        visualizing how our user interface
                        interacts with the user experience. This helps the business department manage the business
                        requirements, and the technical department develops the UI and UX technically.

                            devices) and <strong>Android Studio</strong> (for Android devices). These tools are for

                            Facebook
                            community. It is based on <strong>JavaScript technology</strong> and, more importantly,

                            are the best choices for us. The IDE we choose is <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>, a
                            free IDE from
                            Microsoft. There are some additional tools for the database, such as <strong>SQL or cloud

                        <strong>Image analysis</strong> is the main technology for our product. We use image analysis in
                        2 main features of our product: workout correction and food calculation. Image analysis helps us
                        correct the form of exercises for users. For example, when doing a plank, your arms must be
                        square, and your back must be straight. We will remind the user to correct the form if we detect
                        any incorrectness. Besides, Image analysis also helps us calculate the approximate weight or
                        amount of food users eat. This function will increase the convenience of our product because
                        users do not have to input the food data manually.

                    Our choice of testing method is <strong>Agile Model</strong>. The method suits our project because
                    it is a continuous process of interaction and debugging. These short-period interactions will allow
                    all our team members to participate continuously in the debugging process, enhancing their
                    understanding of the project. Besides, incremental testing will reduce the resources from human to

                        in-depth knowledge of Objective-C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, database, cloud, etc. As newbies
                        in IT, we need to learn more about these requirements, so we cannot fully develop the project in

                    <p class="text-paragraph">
                        <strong>Problem: </strong>Lack of experience in project management is the reason for scope
                        creep. Unnecessary, unexpected, and uncontrolled functions lead to scope creep, affecting the
                        project’s business and technical aspects.

                        <strong>Solution: </strong>The project manager, stakeholders, and sponsors must carefully define

                <p class="text-paragraph">
                    After two months of working on the project, I learned and gained experience from it. The group
                    processes ran very smoothly because we had backup plans for every task we came up with. Our meetings
                    were very effective and fun because of the group members' friendliness. As a group leader, I
                    completed my responsibilities for the group. For example, I planned everything from tasks and
                    meetings to technical work like making prototypes and coding. The outcome met my expectations and
                    standards at the end of the phase. Besides the things that went well, we also have many things that
                    could be improved—our communication. The group's communication is not as effective as it is expected
                    to be. The reason is that some members do not usually check the message for some reason, although we
                    committed to communication rules. This miscommunication leads to confusion for me as a team leader.
                    I cannot track everyone's progress, give feedback on their work, and keep the project on the track
                    we pointed out from the beginning. As a result, I had to make backups for almost everything to
                    ensure we followed the plan. I think the problem is the others' attitudes and mindsets about doing a
                    group project. They thought that this was not important and practical, but it was. So I think their
                    attitude toward the project should be better next time. I was really surprised by my ability to
                    handle such a massive workload in a limited time. For example, I could write a 60 pages report in
                    less than three weeks and write more than 2000 lines of code for the website while managing others'
                    progress and project progress. This project is an excellent chance to improve my soft skills such as
                    writing, communication, project management, and especially leadership skills. More importantly, I
                    made some good friends from working on this project.

                <p class="text-paragraph">
                    As a technical leader in the group, I was mainly in charge of the technical part. In the early stages of the project, all project members shared more than one idea per individual, of which my idea was to create a BMI calculation website and a website selling crime prevention systems. Among them, a website that calculates BMI was adopted as a project idea, which evolved into an idea to create a fitness application. I constantly studied how to prototype an application using Figma and Adobe XD. Furthermore, I have worked on the "Tools and Technologies," "Testing," and "project background" parts of the "final report." 
                </p>
                <p class="text-paragraph">
                    As a group leader, Phan Nhat Minh led and performed many of the tasks well. He planned for our project so that we had a well-planned project plan. Things went well with our group because we had a plan in which the members' roles were well distributed, had frequent face-to-face meetings instead of online meetings, and used sharing platforms to share the progress of the project with the group members in real-time using Google docs and GitHub. However our project was well planned, but what was unfortunate was that some group members needed to follow our plan better. Moreover, the contributions of all the group members needed to be more consistent. Some group members contributed less to the project. It is one of the significant issues that must be improved in the next project. I learned from this project that it was essential to finish the task much earlier than the deadline. When the deadline for my assignment and the deadline for other subjects overlapped or an unexpected problem occurred, it was way harder to complete the assignment than I expected. The most surprising thing I experienced with this project was that it was easier to make a prototype of an application than I thought it would be. Before I started this project, I thought that building a prototype of an application could only be done by professionals working in the field or at least students who learned design. However, when I studied Figma and made a prototype myself, it was not as complicated as I thought. Through this project, I gained the courage to challenge what I thought was complicated.

                <p class="text-paragraph">
                    At first, our group, Group 49, had three members, including Jimin, Huy, and me, because all of us
                    were studying in Mr. Long’s class at 10.30 on Wednesday. However, the course required that each
                    group have at least four members, so Jimin tried to find another member. Then, he found Minh via the
                    SGS Students Discord channel, and our group first met after our class in week 2. It did not take us
                    lots of time to decide about the problem and topic we would do this semester, and Minh was elected
                    to be the group leader with the agreement of all members. He assigned us duties that were suitable
                    for each member’s ability, and we also tried our best to complete our job on time, which he decided,
                    and to prepare most effectively for the presentation in week 12. I was surprised because of Minh’s
                    productivity and responsibility; he made us follow a suitable schedule to finish the project as soon
                    as possible using the best method. Also, I have learned to be more responsible in the duties for
                    which I am responsible and more creative when working in a team. However, we also have some things
                    that need to be improved, one of which is that we should have more meetings and more contact between
                    members.

                <h4>Luong Anh Huy</h4>
                <p class="text-paragraph">
                    I had a great time and learned a lot throughout the whole project. Overall, I am very impressed with
                    our team working process as all our members were active and contributed a lot during the
                    brainstorming phase as well as the execution stage. The scheduling and meeting of the group were
                    very professional and effective, which resulted in a desirable outcome. However, though our team
                    worked cooperatively and synchronously, some miscommunication at the beginning affected our work
                    direction for a while. However, I’m glad it all worked out well in the end. During the process, I
                    was pleasantly surprised with Minh’s ability to plan out our schedule in detail, which helped us a
                    lot with work distribution and orientation, as well as Jimin’s exceptional work on our prototype.
                    Nevertheless, I gained a ton of experience in managing and the production of a whole project during
                    my time working on one with my teammates, and I am looking forward to working with them again if I
                    have the chance.
